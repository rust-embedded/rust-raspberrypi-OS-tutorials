# 💖 Sponsoring the Developers

This repository is the result of the combined efforts of a large number of developers - in terms of
writing the source code, but also in performing code reviews, writing documentation, and handling
issues and PRs. Some of these developers received a salary or other payment from a third-party for
their contributions. Others receive no payment of any kind, and simply hope that others find their
contributions useful.

If you would like to support any of the developers, please take a moment to [click through to their
profiles] to see if they accept sponsorship and/or charitable gifts made in their name.
